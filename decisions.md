# Past decisions

Append only. One row per decision. A row is never edited or deleted, a reversal is a new row.

A row exists when a problem was raised and a decision closed it. Nothing else gets a row.
Problem and decision are one line each. An error code, a trace id or a ticket number goes in Ref, never the error itself.

| Date | Problem | Decision | Ref |
| ---- | ------- | -------- | --- |
